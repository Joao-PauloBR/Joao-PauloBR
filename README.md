<p>ðŸŒ± I'm in the final semester of the Multiplatform Software Development course at the Faculty of Technology of Itapira "Ogari de Castro Pacheco". It's a moment of transition, where everything I've learned is starting to take shape. I'm looking for my first opportunity as a developer, ready to turn ideas into code and solutions that make sense for people. My journey so far has been shaped by practical projects that simulated real-world challenges, giving me a clear vision of how technology can impact the world.</p>

<p>ðŸš€ My education has given me a solid foundation in various areas. I learned to create everything from web interfaces to mobile apps, including databases and even a bit of cloud computing. I worked on integrative projects each semester, which taught me how to combine theory and practice. I also delved into concepts such as:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Agile methodologies, especially Scrum</li>
  <li>Automated testing to ensure quality</li>
  <li>Best practices in software engineering</li>
</ul>

<p>ðŸ’» In my day-to-day, I'm comfortable with code and tools that let me build cool stuff. My focus is on web development, with a special affection for front-end, but I also enjoy exploring the mobile world. I like to think about interfaces that are beautiful and easy to use, always seeking a balance between functionality and aesthetics. My favorite languages and frameworks are those that let me build fast and with quality, and I'm always learning something new to add to my toolbox.</p>

<p>ðŸŒŸ My GitHub is starting to come to life, and soon I'll share projects that show what I can do. I want to work on initiatives that connect people, simplify tasks, or solve problems in smart ways. Whether it's a dynamic website or a mobile app, my goal is to create something impactful. I'm excited to collaborate, learn, and grow as a developer, bringing my energy to projects that inspire.</p>
